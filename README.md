# k8s-vagrant

I couldn't find a good resource for setting up a K8S environment that is easily modified, so this is my attempt in creating such a repo.

Instructions to follow:

Basiscally:

Edit config.yaml for "general" settings
Edit hosts.yaml for host settings

Note: I'm using a public_network so I can access the cluster remote. To configure you need to modify the bridge in config.yaml to your specific interface.
